# PeakabooMobile
XRF Visualization Software for Mobile

Peakaboo allows users to identify the spectral origins of the XRF spectrum using a technique that fits all components of the K, L, or M spectrum including escape peaks and pileup peaks, and then plots their spatial intensity distributions as maps.

This is the mobile version. The desktop version (which is much more mature and feature-complete) can be found ![here](https://github.com/nsherry4/Peakaboo)
